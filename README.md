# Payment-Application
This project represents a simple payment application where the user will enter his account information to make a transaction.
The application will take the user`s data and check if it is correct then check if the card is expired then it will check if the account exists in the database
before checking if the user`s fund is enough for the transaction. If everything gone okay, the transaction will be approved and saved to the database.
